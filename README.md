# MSU-Texas-Game-Jam-2024

## Zachary Barrentine, Zachary Lewis, and Gage Ahlmark participated in:
### --Midwestern State University Texas's Association for Computing Machinery Fall 2024 Game Jam--

## Description: 
### The purpose of this Game Jame was to develop our capabilities both with utilizing Python, more specifically with the Pygame library, as well as grow our skills with coding in a group environment. Much progress was made through this project, however some portions were not able to be complete before the deadline, such as can be seen with the tilemapping.
